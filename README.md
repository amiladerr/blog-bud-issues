# BlogBud
This is the repository for the web page called Blog Bud, inspired by social media platform Twitter.
Blod Bud is a web page where users can share their thoughts via posts and comments. 
It will give the users an opportunity to create their own unique profile where they will store their information as well as all of the posts they wish to publish. 
Naturally, if there are any issues that are to occur, a support page will be available to those who need to get into contact with the moderation team along with a page that is there to familiarize all of the new users with how Blog Bud works.
Admins have the view all published or uploaded information and remove it. They also have the ability to do the same with users.
Once the users have created their profiles, they will be able to edit, hide or delete any information or posts through their personal user menu.
Every post they make will have a comment section so other users can share their opinions and thoughts about the post as well. The creator of the post will have the option to delete certain comments or disable comments altogether.
